## Goal

Got an already working docker compose file for your project? Just send it to your [seelf](https://github.com/YuukanOO/seelf) instance and _boom_, that's live on your own infrastructure with all services correctly deployed and exposed on nice urls as needed! See [the documentation](https://yuukanoo.github.io/seelf/guide/quickstart.html) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Although Docker is the only backend supported at the moment, I would like to investigate to enable other ones too, see [the roadmap](https://github.com/YuukanOO/seelf/milestone/1) .

## Getting started

Check [the documentation](https://yuukanoo.github.io/seelf/guide/quickstart.html) to give **seelf** a try!
