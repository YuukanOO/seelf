# seelf front-end

_I may have to refactor things a bit to make test writable (by using some view model maybe) but that's not a priority for now._

## Developing

Run the following commands to serve the development server and start building.

_In development, call to the `/api/v1` will be proxified to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1` which is the default port for the seelf backend._

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

_You should probably use the `make build` at the root of the seelf project instead._

```bash
npm run build
```
