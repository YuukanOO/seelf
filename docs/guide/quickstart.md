# Quickstart

This quickstart will guide through installing and deploying your first application with **seelf** locally. Doing so, you'll gain a general understanding of different resources managed by **seelf**.

## What is seelf?

**seelf** is a self-hosted software which makes it easy to deploy your **own applications** on your **own hardware** using an easy to use interface.

At its core, **seelf** just reads a `compose.yml` file, **deploy** services which [must be exposed](/reference/providers/docker#exposing-services) and manage **domains** and **certificates** for you.

For the majority of cases, a locally working `compose.yml` file is sufficient, making the **transition from a local stack to a remote one a breeze**.

::: info
For now, only the [Docker provider](/reference/providers/docker) is available but that may change in the future to support others as well, such as **Docker swarm**, **Podman**, **Kubernetes** and so on.
:::

Think of it as an alternative to services like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Dokku](https://dokku.com/), [Caprover](https://caprover.com/), [Coolify](https://coolify.io/).

Now that you know what is **seelf**, let's dive in and go through all the steps needed to deploy an application of our own!

## Prerequisites

Since we're targeting a local docker instance in this tutorial, the **only prerequisite is a docker engine** (>= v18.0.9) up and running.

## Installing

For this quickstart, we'll deploy **seelf** using a local docker engine. If you want to host **seelf** on a remote server, there's better way, see [the installation guide](/guide/installation) for more information.

Launching **seelf** is as easy as:

```sh
docker run -d -e "ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com" -e "ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin" -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -p "8080:8080" yuukanoo/seelf
```

This will launch a **seelf** instance and **create an admin account** with the credentials provided **if no user account exists yet** (if a user already exists, they will be ignored).

::: warning
Since this is a one-shot instance, we do not attach volumes to persist data generated by seelf and everything will be discarded with the container. In a production environment, you must attach them as described in the [installation section](/guide/installation).
:::

You can now head over http://localhost:8080 and sign in using `admin@example.com` and `admin` as the password or **whatever credentials you set above**.

## Create your first target

The first things to do is to define [a target](/reference/targets) which will receive our application deployments.

Head over the [targets page](http://localhost:8080/targets) and click the [New target](http://localhost:8080/targets/new) button.

Fill the form with a name such as `local` and a valid root URL, for this example, we'll go with `http://docker.localhost`. This URL is important since every application will be exposed as a subdomain on it. If it starts with `https`, certificates will be issued automatically.

Go with the default provider options targeting our local docker engine and click **Create**.

Doing so will trigger the [target configuration](/reference/targets#configuration) process, deploying the needed infrastructure (ie. the traefik proxy mainly) on the docker instance.

## Create your first application

Now that we have our target, go to the [applications page](http://localhost:8080/) and click the [New application](http://localhost:8080/apps/new) button.

Let's give it a name such as `welcome`. The application name will determine at which subdomain it will be available. It should be **unique** across **targets** and **environments** to make sure there's no collision on URLs.

We don't need to set anything else for our example, so let's click **Create**.

If you wish to dig further, see the [application reference](/reference/applications).

## Your first deployment

After the application creation, you should see the application page. Click the **New deployment** button to trigger your first [deployment](/reference/deployments).

Depending on wether or not you have filled the application version control settings, different options will be available.

Let's deploy a **Sveltekit application packaged as an archive** in the [examples directory](https://github.com/YuukanOO/seelf/tree/main/examples/sveltekit-hello/) of the seelf source code.

[Download the archive](https://github.com/YuukanOO/seelf/raw/main/examples/sveltekit-hello/sveltekit-hello.tar.gz), select the `project archive` kind in the form dropdown and choose the archive file you've just downloaded in the file input.

Now we're ready to click the **Deploy** button. You should see the deployment logs and after a few seconds/minutes depending if you already have the base images locally, you should be able to access http://welcome.docker.localhost and see the application running!

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you have deployed your first application with **seelf**!

## Cleaning up resources

Before ending this quickstart, let's cleanup every resources we've just deployed.

Go back to **the application page** and click the **Edit application** button. Now, click the **Delete application** button and confirm. If you have successful deployments on an environment, a cleanup will be executed to free up some space and delete everything related to the application.

::: danger
Deleting a resource in **seelf** is always **permanent** and cannot be undone. If you want to make backups, you should do it **before**.
:::

Since we have a deployment, you can view the cleanup progression in the [jobs page](http://localhost:8080/jobs) which list every [background jobs](/reference/jobs) queued by **seelf**.

::: info
Some jobs may be [cancellable](/reference/jobs#cancellation). This is the case for the cleanup ones because in rare cases, it may fails. For example, the target may not be reachable anymore but from the **seelf** perspective, if you have deployed something in the past, it should clean it up.

Cancelling a cleanup job will allow the application deletion in this case.
:::

After a few seconds, your application should be deleted.

We'll do the same for our target. Go to **the target page**, click the **Delete target** button and confirm. The process is the same as for the application one.

And now we're done! Every resources have been properly cleaned up.
