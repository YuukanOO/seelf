# Custom registries

If you need to deploy images hosted on private registries (such as ones using the [registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) image), you can declare them on **seelf** on the appropriate page.

Registries are **shared** across [targets](/reference/targets) and are used during the deployment process as soon as they are configured.
